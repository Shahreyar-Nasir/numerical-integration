Welcome to a practical and modular implementation of **Numerical Integration techniques** using **C**!  
This repository covers various approximation methods to compute definite integrals of real-valued functions where analytical integration is hard or inefficient.

## ðŸ§  Why Numerical Integration?

> Not all functions have antiderivatives that can be expressed in closed-form. Thatâ€™s where numerical integration shines.

It is used when:
- The function is defined by a table of values or is discontinuous
- The integral has no closed-form
- High-speed approximation is needed (e.g., simulations)

## âœ… Implemented Methods

| File                      | Method                    | Strengths |
|---------------------------|---------------------------|-----------|
| `Trapezoidal.c`           | Trapezoidal Rule          | Fast, simple, decent for smooth functions |
| `Simpsons_one_third.c`    | Simpson's 1/3 Rule        | Very accurate, uses parabolic approximation |
| `Simpsons_three_eights.c` | Simpson's 3/8 Rule        | Similar to 1/3 but better for non-even intervals |
| `Romberg.c`               | Romberg Integration       | Extrapolates for better accuracy with fewer evaluations |
| `Gauss_Legendere.c`       | Gauss-Legendre Quadrature| High precision, optimal node placement |
